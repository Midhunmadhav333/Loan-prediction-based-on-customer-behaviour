# Loan-prediction-based-on-customer-behaviour

PROBLEM STATEMENT

The increasing complexity of financial markets and the growing need for responsible lending practices necessitate the development of robust risk evaluation models. This project aims to create an accurate predictive model that assesses the risk associated with lending to potential borrowers. By leveraging historical borrower data, the model will provide insights into the likelihood of default, enabling lenders to make informed decisions that balance financial risk and customer service. The primary goal is to enhance the efficiency of the lending process, minimize defaults, and foster sustainable lending practices.

OBJECTIVE

The main objective of this project is to develop a reliable and accurate model that can evaluate the risk associated with lending money to potential borrowers. By analyzing various customer-related factors and their historical behavior, we aim to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default or repay the loan on time.
